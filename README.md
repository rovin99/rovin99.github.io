# Javascript Game
The code defines a canvas using HTML5 Canvas API and sets its dimensions to the inner dimensions of the window. It also defines an evil circle that can be moved with the arrow keys (left, right, up, and down). The circle has the ability to eliminate the balls on the canvas by collision detection. The balls have properties like color, size, velocity, and position. The code also defines a ball class and generates random balls with random values of size, velocity, and color. The update() method updates the position of the balls, the draw() method draws the balls on the canvas and the collisionDetect() method checks for the collision between the balls and the evil circle. A "Ball count" paragraph element keeps track of the number of balls left on the canvas and an alert message is displayed when all the balls are eliminated.
